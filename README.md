# Piezoresistive sensor to measure Intraocular Pressure

The main objective of the project is to understand piezoresistive concepts and explore applications like Intraocular pressure. Different possible structures are constructed and the accuracy of measurement is analyzed accordingly. We also check the impact of different materials and dimensions of components on the output obtained and subsequent analyzations
